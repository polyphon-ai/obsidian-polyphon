[![CI](https://github.com/polyphon-ai/obsidian-polyphon/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/polyphon-ai/obsidian-polyphon/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/polyphon-ai/obsidian-polyphon)](https://github.com/polyphon-ai/obsidian-polyphon/releases/latest) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE) [![Follow on X](https://img.shields.io/badge/Follow-%40PolyphonAI-000?logo=x&logoColor=white)](https://x.com/intent/follow?screen_name=PolyphonAI)

An Obsidian plugin that connects to a running [Polyphon](https://polyphon.ai) instance, letting you have multi-voice AI conversations from within your vault.

## Requirements

- [Polyphon](https://polyphon.ai) must be installed and running locally (desktop app)
- Obsidian desktop — mobile is not supported

## Installation

The plugin is not yet listed in the Obsidian community plugin directory. Install it manually or via BRAT.

### Manual installation (recommended)

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest)
2. Create the folder `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/polyphon/` if it doesn't exist
3. Copy the three files into that folder
4. Enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**

### BRAT

Install [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat), then add `polyphon-ai/obsidian-polyphon` as a beta plugin. BRAT will keep it up to date automatically.

## Configuration

Open **Settings → Polyphon** after enabling the plugin:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Host | `127.0.0.1` | Hostname or IP of your Polyphon instance |
| Port | `7432` | TCP port Polyphon is listening on |
| API token | *(auto)* | Use **Read local token** to load from the running instance, or paste manually |
| Persist conversations | Off | Save and restore history across restarts |
| Debug mode | Off | Log raw JSON-RPC frames to the console |

The API token is stored at `~/Library/Application Support/Polyphon/api.key` on macOS. The **Read local token** button in settings loads it automatically.

## Usage

1. Start Polyphon
2. Open the sidebar — click the message icon in the ribbon, or use `Cmd/Ctrl+P → Polyphon: Open sidebar`
3. The plugin connects automatically; the status badge shows **online** when ready
4. Select a composition from the dropdown
5. Choose or create a session
6. Type a message and press **Send** or `Enter`

Each voice in the composition responds in the unified thread, labeled by name. Use `@VoiceName` to target a specific voice.

### Voice targeting

Type `@` in the message field to see a dropdown of voices. Select one to direct your message to that voice only.

### Session context

The plugin automatically includes your current open file path in the first message of each session, giving the AI voices context about what you're working on.
